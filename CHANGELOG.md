v7.0.0-alpha.1 - 2022-06-15
---------------------------

##### New Features

+ Added new AJAX checkout and payment source switching endpoints for payment gateways to utilize instead of the preexisting synchronous form submission methods.

##### Bug Fixes

+ Don't attempt to lookup the default payment gateway from user meta data.

##### Deprecations

+ Deprecated `LLMS_Controller_Orders::switch_payment_source()` in favor of `LLMS_Controller_Checkout::switch_payment_source()`.
+ Method `LLMS_Controller_Orders::confirm_pending_order()` is deprecated in favor of `LLMS_Controller_Checkout::confirm_pending_order()`.
+ Method `LLMS_Controller_Orders::create_pending_order()` is deprecated in favor of `LLMS_Controller_Checkout::create_pending_order()`.
+ Method `LLMS_Controller_Orders::switch_payment_source()` is deprecated in favor of `LLMS_Controller_Checkout::switch_payment_source()`.
+ Deprecated hook `llms_{$method}_title` in favor of `llms_{$method}_refund_title`.

##### Developer Notes

+ The `LLMS_Student` object can be instantiated as an empty object and bypass current user autoloading. In the future this may affect integrations using the `lifterlms_new_pending_order` action hook which will receive an "empty" student object during order setup by gateways utilizing new AJAX-powered checkout endpoints.
+ Improved payment gateway secure string logging by adding a method, `add_secure_string()` allowing developers to add secure strings during runtime without the necessity of registering the strings using filters.
+ Implemented new gateway feature: `modify_recurring_payments`. [#2176](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2176)
+ Added new filter `llms_transaction_can_be_refunded` enabling custom refund restrictions to be applied to a transaction.

v6.0.0 - 2022-03-08
-------------------

**This major release of LifterLMS focuses on improving the experience of creating, designing, and managing achievements and certificates: use the block editor to design certificates, sync awards with their templates, award achievements and certificates on demand without requiring an engagement trigger, and [much more](https://lifterlms.com/docs/getting-started-with-lifterlms-6-0/). In addition, this release removes a significant number of previously deprecated classes, methods, and functions. Please read the full Breaking Changes sections for more information on removed code.**

##### New Features

+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates when using WordPress versions 5.8 and later.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include [llms-user] information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code.
+ Added a link to return to the student dashboard when viewing an awarded certificate. [#1959](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1959)
+ Provide additional information to hooks on the student single course reporting screen.

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images will automatically be used for legacy certificates and can be forced by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1081)
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/669)
+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1640)
+ The look and behavior of the certificate {{MINI_CERTIFICATE}} pop-over notification merge code now displays a placeholder preview of the certificate in favor of attempting to render a tiny version of the actual certificate. [#1950](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1950)
+ The coupon code in the student's order details table is now wrapped in a `<code>` tag instead of an `<a>` tag. [#2033](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2033)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.23](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/23/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-23/).
+ Updated LifterLMS Blocks to [version 2.4.0](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/25/lifterlms-blocks-version-2-4-0/).

##### Bug Fixes

+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/535)
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/290)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.
+ Fixed the label hover on picture type quizzes in some themes. [#2015](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2015)

##### Database Migration

+ A database migration is required when upgrading from versions earlier than 6.0.0. A description of the required updates can be found at [https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-database-updates/#600](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-database-updates/#600).

##### Deprecations

  + During the database upgrade from versions earlier than 6.x, an site option, `llms_has_legacy_certificates`  is added when at least one certificate is found. This option will display the settings so they can continue to be used for legacy certificates.
  + After migrating all certificates on a site, the settings will still display. In order to remove them from the screen a developer can either delete the option `llms_has_legacy_certificates` or return `false` from the filter `llms_has_legacy_certificates`.

v6.0.0-rc.1 - 2022-03-03
------------------------

##### New Features

+ Added a link to return to the student dashboard when viewing an awarded certificate. [#1959](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1959)
+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates when using WordPress versions 5.8 and later.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ + Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ + Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include [llms-user] information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code. [Read more](@TODO).
+ Provide additional information to hooks on the student single course reporting screen.

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/669)
+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images can be used by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1081)
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1640)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.23](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/23/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-23/).
+ Updated LifterLMS Blocks to [version 2.4.0](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/25/lifterlms-blocks-version-2-4-0/).
+ The look and behavior of the certificate {{MINI_CERTIFICATE}} pop-over notification merge code now displays a placeholder preview of the certificate in favor of attempting to render a tiny version of the actual certificate. [#1950](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1950)

##### Bug Fixes

+ + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$found_results` property is accessed in `LLMS_Abstract_Notification_Controller::has_subscriber_received()`. + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$max_pages` property is accessed in `lifterlms_template_student_dashboard_my_notifications()`.
+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/290)
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/535)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.

##### Deprecations

+ Public access to properties of the abstract `LLMS_Database_Query` has been deprecated.

v6.0.0-beta.2 - 2022-02-22
--------------------------

##### New Features

+ Added a link to return to the student dashboard when viewing an awarded certificate. [#1959](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1959)
+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates when using WordPress versions 5.8 and later.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ + Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ + Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include [llms-user] information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code. [Read more](@TODO).

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/669)
+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images can be used by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1081)
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1640)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.22](https://make.lifterlms.com/2021/12/15/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-22/).
+ The look and behavior of the certificate {{MINI_CERTIFICATE}} pop-over notification merge code now displays a placeholder preview of the certificate in favor of attempting to render a tiny version of the actual certificate. [#1950](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1950)

##### Bug Fixes

+ + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$found_results` property is accessed in `LLMS_Abstract_Notification_Controller::has_subscriber_received()`. + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$max_pages` property is accessed in `lifterlms_template_student_dashboard_my_notifications()`.
+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/290)
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/535)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.

##### Deprecations

+ Public access to properties of the abstract `LLMS_Database_Query` has been deprecated.
  + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$found_results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_found_results()`.
  + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$max_pages`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_max_pages()`.

  + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_results()`.
  + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$query_vars`. The variable as a whole cannot be publicly accessed, instead use `LLMS_Database_Query::get()` and `LLMS_Database_Query::set()` to read and write to the array.
  + The above changes were made to the abstract class `LLMS_Database_Query` but the following concrete classes that utilize the abstract are also affected by this change: `LLMS_Query_User_Postmeta`, `LLMS_Student_Query`, `LLMS_Query_Quiz_Attempt`, `LLMS_Events_Query`, and `LLMS_Notifications_Query`.

##### Developer Notes

+ Added `LLMS_Awards_Query`, used for querying data about awarded certificates and achievements.
  + The method signature `LLMS_Student::get_achievements()` and `LLMS_Student::get_certificates()` now use this class under tho hood.
  + The previous method signature, which passed data into a direct SQL query, is now deprecated.
+ Achievement and certificate data storage locations have been modified, primarily to reduce reliance on the `wp_postmeta` table which will result in a site-wide performance improvement, especially on large sites.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_content` and `_llms_certificate_content` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_content`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_title` and `_llms_certificate_title` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_title`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_template` and `_llms_certificate_template` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_parent`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_image` and `_llms_certificate_image` have been moved the meta property `_thumbnail_id` in order to utilize the WordPress core's featured image functionality and internal APIs.
+ Reliance on `lifterlms_user_postmeta` for achievement and certificate data will be removed in a future release.
  + User postmeta properties `_achievement_earned` and `_certificate_earned` will continue to be recorded but are no longer being used internally.
  + The `updated_date` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_date`.
  + The `user_id` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_author`.
+ Added new Javascript UI components library, modeled after `@wordpress/components`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/components).
+ Added a new SVG icon library, modeled after `@wordpress/icons`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/icons).
+ The merge code button seen on certificate and email template editors is now an SVG image instead of a PNG.
+ Added utility function for escaping and quoting strings. [#1027](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1027)
+ Added new utility function for stripping prefixes from strings.

##### Performance Improvements

+ Increased the number of files that are autoloaded instead of manually loaded.

v6.0.0-beta.1 - 2022-02-16
--------------------------

##### New Features

+ Added a link to return to the student dashboard when viewing an awarded certificate. [#1959](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1959)
+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates when using WordPress versions 5.8 and later.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ + Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ + Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include `[llms-user]` information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code.

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/669)
+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images can be used by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1081)
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1640)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.22](https://make.lifterlms.com/2021/12/15/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-22/).
+ The look and behavior of the certificate {{MINI_CERTIFICATE}} pop-over notification merge code now displays a placeholder preview of the certificate in favor of attempting to render a tiny version of the actual certificate. [#1950](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1950)

##### Bug Fixes

+ + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$found_results` property is accessed in `LLMS_Abstract_Notification_Controller::has_subscriber_received()`. + Fixed how the protected `LLMS_Notifications_Query::$max_pages` property is accessed in `lifterlms_template_student_dashboard_my_notifications()`.
+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/290)
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/535)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.

##### Deprecations

+ Public access to properties of the abstract `LLMS_Database_Query` has been deprecated.
  + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$found_results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_found_results()`.

##### Developer Notes

+ Added `LLMS_Awards_Query`, used for querying data about awarded certificates and achievements.
  + The method signature `LLMS_Student::get_achievements()` and `LLMS_Student::get_certificates()` now use this class under tho hood.
  + The previous method signature, which passed data into a direct SQL query, is now deprecated.
+ Achievement and certificate data storage locations have been modified, primarily to reduce reliance on the `wp_postmeta` table which will result in a site-wide performance improvement, especially on large sites.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_content` and `_llms_certificate_content` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_content`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_title` and `_llms_certificate_title` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_title`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_template` and `_llms_certificate_template` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_parent`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_image` and `_llms_certificate_image` have been moved the meta property `_thumbnail_id` in order to utilize the WordPress core's featured image functionality and internal APIs.
+ Reliance on `lifterlms_user_postmeta` for achievement and certificate data will be removed in a future release.
  + User postmeta properties `_achievement_earned` and `_certificate_earned` will continue to be recorded but are no longer being used internally.
  + The `updated_date` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_date`.
  + The `user_id` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_author`.
+ Added new Javascript UI components library, modeled after `@wordpress/components`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/components).
+ Added a new SVG icon library, modeled after `@wordpress/icons`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/icons).
+ The merge code button seen on certificate and email template editors is now an SVG image instead of a PNG.
+ Added utility function for escaping and quoting strings. [#1027](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1027)
+ Added new utility function for stripping prefixes from strings.

##### Performance Improvements

v6.0.0-alpha.2 - 2022-01-04
---------------------------

##### New Features

+ Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.

##### Updates and enhancements

+ The site options `lifterlms_certificate_bg_img_width`,
`lifterlms_certificate_bg_img_height`, and

and certificate templates created using the classic editor.

+ Restore certificate save hooks after executing callback updates to facilitate scenarios where more than one certificate is updated in a single request.

##### Bug Fixes

+ Only register the Certificate Title block for use on certificate post types.

##### Updated Templates

+ [templates/certificates/content-legacy.php](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/blob/trunk/templates/certificates/content-legacy.php)


v6.0.0-alpha.1 - 2021-12-28
---------------------------

**This version is an unstable pre-release! We strongly advise against installing this in a production environment.**

##### New Features

+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ + Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include [llms-user] information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code. [Read more](@TODO).

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#669)
+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images can be used by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#1081)
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#1640)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.22](https://make.lifterlms.com/2021/12/15/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-22/).

##### Bug Fixes

+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#290)
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms#535)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.

##### Deprecations

+ Class `LLMS_Achievement_User` is deprecated with no direct replacement.
  + Method `LLMS_Achievement::is_enabled()` is deprecated with no replacement.

+ `llms__created` has been deprecated, use `llms_{$type}_created` where `{$type}` is the database record type defined by the class property.
+ `llms__deleted` has been deprecated, use `llms_{$type}_deleted` where `{$type}` is the database record type defined by the class property.
+ `llms__updated` has been deprecated, use `llms_{$type}_updated` where `{$type}` is the database record type defined by the class property.


v4.2.0 - 2020-07-21
-------------------

##### Updates

+ Admins can now preview the checkout screen as visitors or students using the "View As" function from the WP Admin bar
+ Javascript cookies now set cookies with `sameSite` set to `strict` as recommended by Firefox/Mozilla.
+ Added filters to allow 3rd parties to use LifterLMS completion tracking APIs to "complete" external or non-LMS content.
+ Added "deep" orphan checks when checking the relationship between a quiz and a lesson.
+ Normalized the return structure in `LLMS_Post_Instructors::get_instructors()` when no instructor set, thanks [@nicolas-jaussaud](https://github.com/nicolas-jaussaud)!
+ Update LifterLMS rocket icon used in the WP Admin Bar in the "View As" area.

##### Bug fixes

v4.1.0 - 2020-07-06
-------------------

##### LifterLMS REST 1.0.0-beta.14

+ **Breaking**: `LLMS_REST_Controller::prepare_links()` now requires a second parameter, the `WP_REST_Request` for the current request. Any classes extending and overwriting this method must adjust their method signature to accommodate this change.
+ Bugfix: Fixed issue causing response objects to unintentionally include keys of remapped fields. This error occurs only when extending core controllers and attempting to exclude core fields.


v4.0.0 - 2020-06-25
-------------------

This is a *major* release. Many backwards incompatible changes have been made that may affect your site if you have custom code which rely on previously deprecated functions or methods. If you're not sure about your custom code, test the upgrade in a [staging site](https://lifterlms.com/docs/staging/).

##### Bug Fixes

+ Fixed an issue encountered during quiz grading.
+ Add RTL language support for popover interfaces found throughout the course builder.
+ Fixed issue encountered in MySQL 8.0 when using the bbPress integration.

##### LifterLMS REST API 1.0.0-beta.13

+ Bugfix: Fixed error response messages on the instructors endpoint.
+ Bugfix: Fixed student progress deletion endpoint issues preventing progress from being fully removed.

##### Action Scheduler Library

Switches from prospress/action-scheduler to woocommerce/action-scheduler. The repository has been moved but it's the same library & upgrades to latest version (3.1.6).

While this is a semantically major upgrade of the library there are no backwards incompatible changes to the public API.

There have been several deprecated functions/classes. The LifterLMS core does not directly use any of these deprecated functions but 3rd parties might and should review the changelog of the library to see if they are affected by any deprecations: https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler/releases.

##### Deprecations

+ Function `LLMS()` is deprecated in favor of `llms()`.

##### Templates Modified

+ templates/global/form-login.php
+ templates/global/form-registration.php

##### Miscellaneous Breaking Changes

**WP Session Manager Library**

Removes the bundled WP Session Manager plugin dependency, all public methods included with this plugin have been removed without direct replacements.

**Removed JS dependencies**

Removes bundled JS bootstrap 3 dependencies: "collapse" and "transition"

**Removed CSS Classes**

Removes classnames from student dashboard login and registration form wrapper elements which conflict with bootstrap causing visual issues.

These classes are not used by the LifterLMS core or add-ons and are a legacy class that hasn't been removed for fear of creating backwards compatibility issues with any custom css, 3rd party themes, etc...

+ templates/global/form-login.php: Removes `col-1` class from the `div.llms-person-login-form-wrapper` element.
+ templates/global/form-registration.php: : Removes `col-2` class from the `div.llms-new-person-form-wrapper` element.

**Removed SVG assets and functionality**

+ LifterLMS no longer utilizes SVGs powered by the `LLMS_Svg` class. The class has been deprecated and removed (see below).
+ The `assets/svg` directory (and all SVG assets contained within) has been removed.
+ The constant `LLMS_SVG_DIR` has been removed.

v3.0.0 - 2016-10-10
-------------------

**This is a massive update which _breaks_ backwards compatibility for many LifterLMS features. A database migration is also necessary for upgrading users to reformat certain pieces of information which are being accessed differently in 3.0.0**

**We strongly recommend that you backup your website before upgrading and, if possible, test LifterLMS 3.0.0 in a non-public-facing testing environment to ensure compatibility with your theme and other plugins and to ensure that 3.0.0 changes do not adversely affect your existing website.**

**Please thoroughly read the following changelog and, if necessary, submit support tickets or post in the forums with any questions _prior_ to upgrading. LifterLMS Support _cannot_ and _will not_ manually resolve migration issues which may arise from upgrading to 3.0.0.**

+ New shortcodes to be documented later, checkout "includes/class.llms.shortcodes.php" if you're feeling anxious
+ All kinds of CSS changes to make LifterLMS, in general, be a little less old looking
+ Added a number of CSS classes to various areas in the Checkout template at "templates/checkout/form-checkout.php"
+ Added a "Cancel" button that allows you to hide the coupon form if the user decides not to add a coupon
+ Removed jQuery animations from the coupon form toggle in favor of a CSS class toggle. If you decide you want some animations on the form add some CSS transitions to the `.llms-coupon-entry` element (and children) to change when the class `.active` is added or removed from the element.
+ Refactored JavaScript related to LifterLMS Checkout. Improvements are minimal (if any) but the file is now smaller and more readable! Yay code stuff.
+ Fixed some redundant text on single payment confirmation screen. ("Single payment of single payment of")
+ Added a link to memberships listed under "My Memberships" on the LifterLMS Account Screen
+ LifterLMS Order posts have been renamed in the database from "order" to "llms_order" to prevent any potential conflicts with other plugins. Automated database migration will handle the renaming of old orders.
+ Fixed undefined variable notice generated by Sections without any lessons inside of them
+ renamed function `add_query_var_product_id()` to `llms_add_query_var_product_id()`
+ added a class for interacting with a course TRACK, instantiated by a track term or term_id (`LLMS_Track`)
+ password strength meter and related settings / options via utilizing WordPress password strength functions available
+ cleaned up the lesson locked tooltips to be a bit more sane and also utilized in course navigation on individual lessons.
+ Updated admin menus for LifterLMS content to be more sane and organized and intuitive and so on and so forth

##### Payment Gateways

**NOTE: at this release, LifterLMS PayPal is the only payment gateway that will work with this release. We haven't started working on Stripe 4.0.0 which will work with LifterLMS 3.0.0**

+ Payment gateways powered by a new abstract gateway class
+ PayPal has been removed from LifterLMS and is available as premium extension

##### Frontend Notices

+ LifterLMS "Notices" have been rewritten, slightly.
+ Most templates have been updated
+ associated CSS has been updated
+ Some sanity has been added to the related functions

##### Post "Model" Concept / Overhaul

Updated classes for programmatically accessing all sorts of data related to custom post types registered by LifterLMS.

These post types currently include:

+ Access Plans -- a non-public post type associated with courses and memberships which store payment related information
+ Coupons (replaces includes/class.llms.coupon.php)
+ Courses (replaces includes/class.llms.course.php)
+ Lessons (replaces includes/class.llms.lesson.php)
+ Memberships
+ Orders (replaces includes/class.llms.order.php
+ Products -- can be instantiated from courses or memberships (replaces includes/class.llms.product.php)
+ Transaction -- a non-public post type associated with orders which store completed/attempted transaction data

##### Improved admin metabox methods (and related)

+ Updated custom LifterLMS Admin Metaboxes to have a more sane programmatic interface. This affects nearly all admin metabox classes in the plugin.
+ A set of methods and classes have been added to improve the programmatic interface around custom post type post tables. These can be found in "includes/admin/post-types/post-tables"

  + _First Payment Discount_ -- Applies only to recurring payment coupons. Determines the discount applied to the first payment of a recurring payment transaction.
  + _Recurring Payments Discount_ -- Applies only to recurring payment coupons. Determines the discount applied all payments (other than the first) of a recurring payment transaction.
  + _Description_ -- Record internal notes for a coupon visible only by admins on the admin panel
+ The "Coupon Code" field has been removed in favor of the WordPress Coupon Post Title being utilized as the code. After upgrading, an automated database migration will move all coupon code fields to the title. The title previously functioned as the coupon description. During the migration the existing title will be moved to the new description field.

##### Orders

+ Added Order Statuses

+ LifterLMS is now 100% Translated into Russian thanks to our new Russian Translation Editor [@kellerpt](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kellerpt/)

##### l18n

+ All transition messages between questions during a Quiz are now translatable.
+ LifterLMS subpages below the LifterLMS icon on the admin panel will now always display regardless of how you've chosen to translate the menu items. Hopefully puts to rest a long-standing i18n issue.

###### Bug fixes

+ Attempting to access a quiz when not enrolled in the associated course and having not properly started the quiz now results in a useful error message rather than a PHP warning.
+ We've adjusted the way we're adding a admin panel "separator" to reduce conflicts with other plugins that have menu items with the same position as our separator (51).
+ Added new logic to display an error message (instead of nothing) if there's an error during question loading.
+ Resolve issue with course progress bar when added to a quiz sidebar (assuming your theme has sidebar support on your quizzes).
+ Updated version number in the changelog for last version (it was supposed to be 2.7.6)


v2.7.6 - 2016-06-28
-------------------

+ Students manually removed by Memberships by using the "Students" tab of a LifterLMS Membership will now be fully removed from the membership.
+ Updated a few time-related strings to be l18n friendly. These items were all around Quiz time reporting and quiz time limits.
+ Updated testing information, tested up to WP 4.5.3
+ Fixed date of last release on changelog. It had the wrong date. Does that really matter?
+ Updated readme.txt description area, we have a new youtube video! Yassss.


v2.7.5 - 2016-06-13
-------------------

##### New features
+ Added an "id" parameter to both LifterLMS Courses and LifterLMS Memberships shortcodes

##### i18n
+ Allow date translation on quiz results screen by using `date_i18n()` instead of `date()`
+ Allow date translation on my courses screen by using `date_i18n()` instead of `date()`
+ Ensure course status "Enrolled" is translatable on my courses screen

##### Fixes
+ Thanks to [@kjohnson](https://github.com/kjohnson) who fixed undefined index warnings & errors which occurred when viewing the last lesson in a section when the next section contained no lessons.
+ Resolved an issue where formatting for "Restricted Access Description" course content would not display proper formatting.
+ Fixed an issue with the "FREE" stamp for a free lesson caused layout issues.
+ Removed the "is-complete" css class from incorrectly being added to lesson preview tiles for free lessons
+ Fix an escaping issue when rendering Course titles inside LifterLMS notices. Prevents "\'s" from displaying when "'s" should be displaying (and similar issues).


v2.7.4 - 2016-05-26
-------------------

+ Fixed a bug with the new localization methods from 2.7.3
+ Removed bundled it_IT translation files in favor of official language pack available at [https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/lifterlms/language-packs](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/lifterlms/language-packs).
+ Removed bundled en_US translation files because LifterLMS is in English so the files are unnecessary.
+ Fixed a few mis-labeled filters applied when registering LifterLMS Custom Post Types
+ Adjusted the default supported features of LifterLMS Quizzes and Questions
  + Quizzes now support custom fields as per user request
  + Commenting, thumbnails, and excerpts are no longer "supported" as they were never intended to be and were never correctly implemented.
    + If you are relying on any of these features for your quizzes or questions please use the following filters to re-implement these features: `lifterlms_register_post_type_quiz` or `lifterlms_register_post_type_question`. These will allow you filter the default arguments LifterLMS passes to the WordPress function `register_post_type()`


v2.7.3 - 2016-05-23
-------------------

+ Added a separate filter for login redirects `lifterlms_login_redirect` and added the user_id as a second parameter available to the filter.
+ Added second parameter to `lifterlms_registration_redirect` to allow access to the registered user's user_id.
+ Fixed a timestamp conversion issue on Course sale price checks that caused indefinite sales (those with no date restrictions) to appear not on sale during certain periods of time. The period would differ depending on the server's timezone settings and the time of visit.
+ Added a "Pointer" when hovering quiz summary accordion to allow for a slightly more obvious user experience that the elements are expandable.
+ Added some new localization methods to ensure strings that only appear in Javascript files will be translator friendly. This initially fixes a few issues on the Quiz Summary page and during quiz taking where strings only appeared in Javascript and were, therefore, completely inaccessible to translators.


v2.7.2 - 2016-05-19
-------------------

+ In course syllabus widget & shortcodes free lessons will now be clickable links.
+ Record `llms_last_login` timestamp in usermeta when a user registers.


v2.7.1 - 2016-05-09
-------------------

##### Enrollment & Voucher Checks

+ Enrollment functions will now automatically check to ensure that users are not already enrolled in a course or membership before enrolling. This addresses an issue which would create double enrollment for user redeeming a voucher for a product they were already enrolled in.
+ Vouchers will now automatically check to see if the user has already redeemed this voucher before allowing the user to redeem it. This would have caused multiple enrollments and would allow one user to eat up an entire voucher by using it over and over again for funsies. A voucher can now *only* be redeemed once by a user as intended.
+ `llms_is_user_enrolled()` now allows developers to check membership enrollment. Previously this function would only check enrollment of Courses despite what the documentation stated.

##### Translation

+ 3 strings have had translation functions added to them. This makes LifterLMS voucher redemptions translatable!

##### Bugs & Fixes

+ Fix javascript dependency & enqueueing issue on admin panel which prevented LifterLMS settings from saving correctly in various places
+ Removed inline CSS from "next lesson button" on quiz completion / summary screen. This was overriding some default styles and making the button very thin and gross.


v2.7.0 - 2016-05-05
-------------------

##### LifterLMS Custom User Fields Exposed

+ Custom fields added during registration via LifterLMS account settings are now exposed on the admin panel via the student's WordPress user profile
+ All custom fields that are available (billing and phone) are editable on the WordPress user profile by anyone with profile edit access regardless of LifterLMS settings. If the settings are disabled (eg not required for registration) you can still add this information manually to a user's profile. This is useful if you require the information and then disable it later, you would still be able to access the information on the admin panel but would no longer be required for user's during registration.
+ A few new filters added to help developers customize the experience here. Check out the documentation at [https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-filters/#admin-user-custom-fields](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-filters/#admin-user-custom-fields)

##### Membership Manual Add & Remove Student Functions

+ Duplicated "Students" tab from the Course admin screen to Memberships
  + Students can be manually added to a membership by an admin
  + Students can be removed manually from a membership by an admin

##### Updates

+ Added the ability for students to edit their phone number via their account settings page if the phone number registration option is enabled on the site.

##### Fixes

+ Fixed a few spelling errors on LifterLMS admin panel order screens
+ Fixed a typo on meta data for LifterLMS admin created (manual) orders


v2.6.3 - 2016-05-02
-------------------

+ Removed redirecting action from WooCommerce integration that was causing issues on multiple product purchase checkouts with larger databases.
+ Added a new payment action `lifterlms_order_complete` which runs at the same time as some previous actions during payment processing but servers a different purpose. This is mostly in preparation for a forthcoming AffiliateWP integration.
+ Fixed an issue with LifterLMS certificate background image that caused the wrong dimensions to be returned when outputting a LifterLMS certificate background image


v2.6.2 - 2016-04-27
-------------------

+ Fix class conflict in collapsible course outline widget template which caused some UX issues.
+ Added new filters run during course & lesson sidebar registration to allow customization of LifterLMS sidebars
  + `lifterlms_register_course_sidebar`
  + `lifterlms_register_lesson_sidebar`
+ Removed a stray logging function.
+ Cleaned up some undefined variable warnings & notices on the quiz summary template
+ Fixed an issue appearing when registering users did not submit the optional phone number which caused a PHP notice
+ LifterLMS Orders generated by WooCommerce will now have a payment method of "WooCommerce". This also addresses an undefined notice produced during WooCommerce order completion because a LifterLMS Payment Method wasn't being defined.


v2.6.1 - 2016-04-26
-------------------

+ Fix class conflict in collapsible course outline widget template which caused some UX issues.


v2.6.0 - 2016-04-25
-------------------

##### Collapsible Course Outline Widget

+ By request we've added an option to make your course outline widgets collapsible!
+ View feature [Documentation](https://lifterlms.com/docs/course-syllabus-widget/)
+ New translations available related to feature. I think it's 4 strings.

##### Bug Fixes

+ Removed an unused CSS selector that caused some issues on the admin panel. This resolves an issue identified with the Page Builder by SiteOrigin plugin. The selector was very generic (`.title`) and may have caused issues with other themes or plugins using that class.
+ Resolved an issue that prevented post update, save, and publishing messages for core post types (posts, pages) from displaying properly.


v2.5.1 - 2016-04-22
-------------------

+ Fixed session handler initialization as it was being initialized prior to user data availability.
+ Staged `LLMS_Language` class  for deprecation in favor of WordPress translation functions `__()`, `_e()`, etc... **If you're a developer you'll start seeing warning's on screen or in your logs if you're using this function, it will be completely removed in the next MAJOR release (3.0.0)**
+ Added a new function to handle the deprecation warning above (`llms_deprecated_function`) and now that we have this function we'll start deprecating all the things. Just kidding, or am I?
+ This gives translators access to 69 new strings that were previously untranslatable! However, this number might be inaccurate +/- 5 strings. I only counted it once and I don't feel like the exact number is important enough for a recount to ensure accuracy. /shrug


v2.5.0 - 2016-04-15
-------------------

**Admin Panel Order Table Updates**

+ Several visual improvements to the table
+ Exposed the following fields on the table
  + Order number
  + Customer name (with a link to their WP profile)
  + Customer email (mailto link)
  + Payment gateway used (this is filterable per gateway as well so gateways can improve the functionality here in the future)
+ Added a link to the product edit page from the product column
+ Free orders will now display as "Free" as opposed to {currency}0.00
+ Removed the not-so-useful "Order" column which was a long ugly string of data that was displayed in other columns already
+ Removed the "Password Protected" flag since *all* orders are always automatically password protected for added security. This flag distracts from the interface so we've removed it. Orders _are_ still password protected though.
+ Numerous strings that were previously not translatable have been made translatable on this screen
+ A few new strings that previously didn't exist are now available for translation

**Fixes and other small changes**

+ Fixed a translation issue on the LifterLMS menu that we thought we fixed in the last release but have now really fixed (probably).
+ Fixed a few small issues with engagements as they related to external engagements triggered by other plugins and LifterLMS extensions.
+ Tired of seeing a banner for a plugin you've already installed? We have your back! The general settings area will now only display banners for plugins that aren't installed.
+ Fixed various javascript issues, mostly removed `console.log()` statements.
+ Fixed a spelling error on the membership admin panel settings screen


v2.4.1 - 2016-04-07
-------------------

+ Tested and compatible with WordPress 4.5 Release Candidate.
+ Fixed a pagination issue related to updates to the quiz builder from 2.4.0 which would cause results to return incorrect results on the last page of paginated results in the "Add Question" dropdown.
+ Added translation functions to LifterLMS Menu Items. Resolves an issue where translated LifterLMS installations might not see all the menu items under the LifterLMS Icon.
+ Italian translation updates courtesy of [@AndreaBarghigiani](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani)
+ On some themes the "Next Lesson" button was displayed while quizzes were being taken. We now *always* hide the next lesson button when a quiz is being taken.
+ Adjusted some static functions to be non static in `class.llms.post-types.php`
+ Added a function to ensure support for post thumbnails on LifterLMS custom post types
+ If a user views a course that is available to them because it belongs to a membership level they are a member of, course pricing information will no longer be visible. This addresses a confusing user experience issue. Previously it _appeared_ like payment for a course was still required even though it really wasn't.
+ Fixed undefined variable warning on quiz summary screen
+ Resolve an issue with quiz timer that caused issues on time display if the time limit was set to a fraction of a minute (eg 1.5 minutes)
+ resolved an undefined variable warning resulting from courses still holding a reference to a membership after the membership has been deleted or trashed


v2.4.0 - 2016-03-29
-------------------

##### Performance Improvements on the LifterLMS Quiz Builder

+ Completely rewrote Javascript associated with building a LifterLMS Quiz. Our users have been identifying some performance issues and slowness when working with larger databases. We've refactored the Javascript and our related database queries to allow faster quiz building and fewer timeouts when working in the quiz builder.
+ Fixed a bunch of undefined variables that would produce PHP warnings in various quiz templates
+ Added validation to quiz questions on the admin panel to prevent the same question from being added to a quiz multiple times.
+ Fixed an issue that prevented quizzes from correctly marking the lesson as completed when the quiz was passed.
+ Added three new actions now available for developers to hook into.
  + `lifterlms_quiz_completed` called upon completion of a quiz (regardless of grade)
  + `lifterlms_quiz_passed` called when a quiz is completed with a passing grade
  + `lifterlms_quiz_failed` called when a quiz is completed with a failing grade
+ Course Progress and Course Syllabus shortcodes (and widgets) now work on Quiz pages
+ Completed Metabox refactor for the LifterLMS Quiz post type and removed `LLMS_Meta_Box_Quiz_General` class. All functions now exist in `LLMS_Meta_Box_Quiz`
+ Added validation to the Quiz general settings
  + Cannot only enter numbers in attempts, percentage, and time limit fields
  + Cannot enter a negative number or a number greater than 100 in the percentage field
+ Removed the membership restriction metabox from quiz admin and question admin screens

##### Other fixes

+ Fixed an issue that caused multiple certificates awarded for the same Course or Lesson to not properly display on the My Account page.
+ Removed an event bound to the publishing of a LifterLMS Question that called a function that didn't exist and caused a Javascript error on the console (but didn't actually cause any problems)
+ Removed a warning message that would display on sidebars when a shortcode was being displayed in a place that it couldn't function. We now simply don't display any content if the shortcode can't function.
+ Resolved an issue that prevent users from "purchasing" products when using a 100% coupon and the Stripe payment gateway. Users experiencing this issue should also update to Stripe 3.0.1.
+ Fixed an AJAX related issue that was incompatible with PHP7
+ Added the ability to have a "max" value on LifterLMS Admin Metabox number fields


v2.3.0 - 2016-03-24
-------------------

##### Engagements Refactoring (lots of bugfixes, performance improvements, more hook & filter friendly)

+ We've completely rewritten the LifterLMS Engagement Handler methods (`class LLMS_Engagements`) and added some new engagement actions.
+ The rewrite unifies engagement handling into one function that can be easily hooked into by plugin and theme developers.
+ We've moved any engagement related data out of the main `LifterLMS` class
+ Fixed the broken engagement delay functionality which now runs of `wp_schedule_single_event`. This makes the function more reliable and also keeps it within the traditional WordPress architecture.
+ Added an additional check before sending emails or triggering any engagements that will prevent the achievement from being awarded or the email from being sent if the post is in not published. This fixes an issue that caused emails in the trash from still being emailed.
+ Removed the unused `LLMS_Engagements` class and file
+ Added two new engagement trigger events "Membership Purchased" and "Course Purchased"
+ Deprecated actions -- Removes some redundancy because the triggering actions (`lifterlms_course_completed` triggered the notification action, instead `lifterlms_course_completed` simply triggers the engagement now).
  + `lifterlms_lesson_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_section_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_track_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_course_completed_notification`
  + `lifterlms_user_purchased_product_notification`
  + `lifterlms_created_person_notification`

##### Bug and Issue fixes

+ Adjusted the size of the LifterLMS Admin Menu Icon. It was super big because of, perhaps, some overcompensation. It caused an issue on Gravity Forms admin pages for some reason (we didn't ever determine why) but we've resolved it by using an appropriately sized icon.
+ Fixed a CSS issue that caused some weirdness on the course archive page on mobile devices
+ Fixed an issue with automated membership expirations
+ Fixed a function that should have been called statically in `LLMS_Ajax` class
+ Fixed a ton of issues related to the triggering of engagements and cleaned up a lot of classes and functions associated with them.
+ Properly instantiate `LifterLMS` singleton via LLMS() function and prevent direct instantiation of the class via `new LifterLMS()`.
+ Removed the deprecated 'class.llms.email.person.new.php' file as it was rendered useless a long time ago and caused some duplicate emails.


v2.2.3 - 2016-03-15
-------------------

##### Translations

+ Added translation functions around quite a few untranslated strings. Thanks to the team at [Netzstrategen](http://netzstrategen.com)
+ Added German translation .mo and .po files again thanks to the team at [Netzstrategen](http://netzstrategen.com)

##### Student Enrollment Functions

We've refactored a bit of our code related to how to programmatically enroll a student in a course or membership during registration and purchase.

A new class `LLMS_Student` makes working with a LifterLMS student (user) a bit easier. We'll begin exposing user meta data through this class as we continue to improve the usability of the codebase for other developers.

We've also created a simple enrollment function `llms_enroll_student()` which enables programmatic enrollment to LifterLMS courses or memberships. This was previously handled in a pretty schizophrenic manner and this unifies various ways of enrollment into one clean function. All enrollment moving forward will use this functions.

The enrollment function calls a new action as well as calling existing enrollment-related actions:

+ `before_llms_user_enrollment` - called immediately prior to beginning the user enrollment function
+ `llms_user_enrolled_in_course` (previously existing)
+ `llms_user_added_to_membership_level` (previously existing)

This also addresses an issue that prevented the `llms_user_enrolled_in_course` action from being called when a user was auto-enrolled in a course because they joined a membership level that included auto-enrollment in one or more courses.

##### Bug and Issue fixes

+ Fixed an inconsistency in the way membership IDs were being saved to the postmeta table that would cause courses to not *appear* restricted on the Membership Enrollment tab, even though they were actually restricted and functioning correctly.
+ New lines are now preserved in the quiz question clarification text areas, thanks to @atimmer
+ Escape HTML in the quiz question description fields on the admin panel to allow outputting html without rendering it, thanks @atimmer
+ Fixed an issue related to the outputting of restricted course and membership content which caused errors on certain themes
+ added a clearfix to the `.llms-lesson-preview` element on the course syllabus template
+ Removed the `class.llms.person.handler.php` file as it wasn't actually being used by anything anywhere and contained no functions
+ Removed some unused and deprecated class functions from the LLMS Student Metabox class
+ Fixed an undefined javascript error resulting from code cleanup in 2.2.2. This issue prevented Vouchers from being published. The code has been further cleaned.


v2.2.2 - 2016-03-15
-------------------

##### One step closer to a public GitHub repository

We've made a massive syntactical update to almost every file in the codebase for a (finally) unified and clearly defined coding standard. This puts us one step closer to beginning to open our GitHub repo publicly and accepting pull requests and contributions from developers everywhere.

Okay, we haven't exactly _clearly_ defined it yet. We're working off a modified version of the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/).

Notable exceptions are related to file names because Thomas Levy didn't have the energy to rename a bunch of files as well as ignoring the Yoda Conditions standards. We'll be fixing these deviations in the future.

##### Quizzes

+ Created new time calculation and humanizing functions related to the display of quiz time on quiz results pages
+ Quizzes will now display hours, minutes, and seconds depending on the time it took to take the quiz
+ Timing calculations are more accurate and quizzes that are completed in less than 60 seconds will not bug out and display incredibly long lengths
+ Resolved an issue that occasionally prevented quiz data from saving during the last question causing the quiz to hang in an uncompletable state
+ Quiz questions now have a default point value of 1, thanks @atimmer
+ Quiz question answers now accept valid HTML as per `wp_kses_post`, thanks again to @atimmer

##### Translations

+ Thanks to @AndreaBarghigiani and the team at [codeat](http://codeat.co/) LifterLMS now ships with Italian language files!

##### Issue and bug resolutions

+ Fixed a restriction issue that would happen when individual lessons were restricted to a membership level
+ Fixed an issue with the `[lifterlms_my_account]` shortcode that was preventing the shortcode from working on the Divi theme.
+ Engagements will now only be triggered if they are "Published". Resolves an issue where draft or trashed engagements were still firing.
+ Fixed CSS overflow on LifterLMS Meta boxes. Fixes an issue where select boxes would be hidden inside a metabox.
+ Changed the ConvertKit extension banner image on the LifterLMS general settings page and replaced added a link to the extension now that it's available.
+ Added a link to the new ConvertKit extension to the .org readme
+ When restricting an entire site to a membership level the page selected as the "Terms and Conditions" page in LifterLMS settings will automatically bypass Membership restriction settings. This will allow your unregistered users to actually read the T&C that they're confirming during registration.
+ CSS fix for `has-icon` class on course syllabus
+ Fixed a PHP warning that displayed when purchasing a membership with no auto-enrollment courses
+ Fixed an undefined variable warning in the WooCommerce integration class
+ Fixed a few templating issues related to certificates
+ Added a few new CSS rules that should make certificates more compatible across various themes
+ Added a css class to LifterLMS Next Lesson buttons, `llms-next-lesson`
+ Updated the scheduled event name for cleaning up LifterLMS session data from the WP database. It had a conflicting name with the scheduled event for expiring LifterLMS memberships.


v2.2.1 - 2016-03-07
-------------------

+ Added a few actions to the `class.llms.voucher.php` class.


v2.2.0 - 2016-03-04
-------------------

##### Translations

+ We've updated our .pot file for the first time in quite a while. We're really sorry for de-emphasizing translation. An updated .pot file will now accompany each version of LifterLMS whenever a translatable string is adjusted or when a new string is added.
+ We've also made it easier to include custom translations. Read our [Translation Guide](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/getting-started-with-translation).

##### Certificate Background Images

_We've completely rewritten the certificates template (but it's all backwards compatible)._

+ New filters are available to make customizing the certificate template easier for developers. All new filters are documented at [https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/functions-certificates](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/functions-certificates).
+ A new WordPress Image Size is now available and will be used for generating the image used by default when uploading certificates to the media library. Fore more information on these new settings visit [https://lifterlms.com/docs/certificate-background-image-sizes/](https://lifterlms.com/docs/certificate-background-image-sizes/).

##### Course and Membership Pricing & Sales

+ Sale price start and end date are now completely optional.
  + Provide neither a start date nor an end date to have a sale run indefinitely
  + Provide a start date with no end date to have a sale start at a pre-determined time with no pre-determined ending
  + Provide an end date with no start date to have a sale end a a pre-determined date but start immediately
  + Provide a start date and an end date to have a sale run for a pre-determined period of time
+ Optimized the `LLMS_Product` class to provide more reliable and extendable use of the class
+ The templates related to pricing functions have been refactored. Affected templates include: "templates/course/price.php", "templates/loop/price.php", "templates/membership/price.php"
+ Many people complained about the size of the `.llms-price` element on course and membership tiles on loop pages. We removed the inflated size and will now default to your theme for sizing. You selector remains the same if you wish to customize the size of the price text.

##### Coupon Updates

+ Coupons can (finally) be removed after being applied!
+ Coupons can now be restricted to specific courses and/or memberships
+ Percentage based coupons can no longer be created with a value larger than 100%
+ Added numeric restrictions to usage and coupon amount fields on the admin panel
+ Fixed a programmatic error that prevented product restrictions from being entirely removed
+ Fixed a few instances where hardcoded a US Dollar symbol ($) where a dynamic currency symbol should have been displayed.

##### Wow Bad Syntax, Very Typo, Such Grammar, So Undefined

+ Fixed a typo in filter associated with modifying the registration of the lesson post type (`lifterlms_register_post_type_lesson`)
+ Fixed a grammatical error in a Membership restriction message
+ Fixed a syntax error in "/templates/course/outline-list-small.php" that prevented the `done` CSS class from being properly applied to completed lessons
+ Fixed a few typos and grammatical errors on the Course and Membership settings metaboxes
+ Fixed an undefined variable in "templates/course/syllabus.php"
+ Fixed an issue on the system report that prevented the "Courses Page" from being reported properly
+ Fixed an issue that caused PHP warnings on the admin panel for students or WP users with no LifterLMS menu permissions
+ Fixed an installation warning caused by a reference to an undefined class variable
+ Fixed an HTML character encoding issue that caused `&ndash;` to display on the admin panel when viewing LifterLMS Orders
+ Fixed an undefined variable found during engagement triggering for non-email engagements.

##### Additional, less exciting updates

+ Added input type restrictions to course & membership price fields.
+ The "Emails" LifterLMS Settings Tab has been renamed "Engagements." All Email settings are found under this tab as well as some new settings related to other kinds of LifterLMS engagements.
+ Added `the_content` filter to the content of emails sent by LifterLMS
+ Fixed some CSS issues on Voucher screens
+ Updated Courses settings retrieval function to retrieve the correct "shop" page id
+ Added translation functions to voucher export meta box class
+ Vouchers Export metabox will only allow export after a voucher has been published. This prevents an issue caused by attempting to export voucher codes before they were saved in the database via the publish / save action.
+ Vouchers can no longer be saved with a use of "0"
+ added a CSS class for various syllabus outputs that notes that the lesson has an icon. Previously CSS relied on "is-complete" to output styles for having an icon but with the addition of placeholders the "is-complete" is used only to note that the lesson is completed and "has-icon" is a more semantic class that applies to both complete and incomplete lessons with an icon.
+ Removed the membership restriction metabox from some post types where it shouldn't have been displaying.
+ admin select fields now have an option `allow_null` (default to "true") which can be set to `false` in order to prevent the output of the default "None" option


v2.1.1 - 2016-02-15
-------------------

##### System Report

+ A new LifterLMS Admin Page is available which reports information about various server, WordPress, and LifterLMS settings that will help expedite support requests.
+ More information about the system report is available at [https://lifterlms.com/docs/how-to-use-the-lifterlms-system-report/](https://lifterlms.com/docs/how-to-use-the-lifterlms-system-report/)

##### Additional Updates

+ Fixed a javascript issue which prevented users from saving vouchers
+ Cleaned up formatting in a large number of included PHP files


v2.0.5 - 2016-02-15
-------------------

+ PayPal requests now using HTTP Version 1.1 in preparation for June 2016 [TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 Updates](https://www.paypal-knowledge.com/infocenter/index?page=content&widgetview=true&id=FAQ1914&viewlocale=en_US). This resolves user's inability to begin PayPal checkout when using Sandbox mode.
+ Updated deprecated function opt out to run off a constant that can be defined in `wp-config.php` instead of using a filter that is hard to use in the way that it is intended.


v2.0.4 - 2016-02-15
-------------------

+ Fixed a typo on the `class_exists` check in the deprecated functions file
+ added a filter so that progressive users can opt out of loading the deprecated functions file


v2.0.3 - 2016-02-12
-------------------

+ Removed an unused quiz stub


v2.0.2 - 2016-02-11
-------------------

+ Bugfix: removed a progressive syntax array that caused fatal errors on older versions of PHP


v2.0.1 - 2016-02-11
-------------------

##### Updated General Settings Screen

+ Improved the general settings interface to be more visually appealing and to provide some ad space to alert customers to other LifterLMS products and information.
+ Moved Currency options to the Checkout settings screen

##### Bug Fixes

+ Properly initialized jQuery on the vouchers metabox admin scripts
+ removed some php shortcut echos (`<?= $var; ?>`)
+ Resolve issue where courses that are available with a membership or on it's own outside of the membership would prevent users from accessing content if they were not a member.
+ Fixed a few files where undefined variables were being referenced and generating php notices
+ removed an call to a WordPress core function that has never existed. Not sure what we were thinking there...

###### Enhancements

+ Updated CSS to provide better course syllabus layout on smaller screens
+ Added validation to prevent against duplicate voucher code creation


v2.0.0 - 2016-02-04
-------------------

##### Auto-advancing lessons

+ We've heard your feedback and added a new global course option which will auto-advance a student to the next lesson upon lesson completion.

##### Bug Fixes

+ Added spaces between numbers and "of" on the counter for course syllabus templates
+ Removed a template hook that was creating duplicate lesson thumbnails on quite a few themes

##### Membership Admin Improvements

Visit the "Enrollment" tab on any membership to see some new additions to make managing your memberships easier.

+ You can now add courses to and remove courses from a Membership from the Membership itself
+ You can now opt to automatically enroll students in a course (or multiple courses) when they sign up for a membership by checking "Auto Enroll" next to the course on the Membership enrollment tab

##### Student Enrollment & Removal on Courses Admin Screen

We've updated the Students tab interface for performance and usability!

+ AJAX enabled searching by student name and or email
+ Increased performance for course page load by only calling student information when needed. This resolves a bug identified by users with large user databases and/or low-powered servers.
+ Allow for addition or removal of several students at a time.

##### Syllabus Template

+ Added a Course setting to optionally enable Lesson Thumbnails on the Course Syllabus
+ Added a Course setting Display greyed out lesson completion checkmark icons on lessons not competed in the course syllabus
+ Reworded CSS on the course syllabus to rely on floats rather than absolute positioning, should allow for more robust customization with less frustration
+ Refactored the syllabus template at "templates/course/syllabus.php" for better performance and readability

##### Updates and enhancements

+ User email is now displayed on the "Students" table on student analytics screens
+ Membership now has it's own admin menu
+ Reordered the LifterLMS admin menu and submenu items
+ Removed membership specific taxonomies from courses
+ Removed course specific taxonomies from memberships
+ Coupon code is now a required field when creating a coupon
+ "Humbled" the metabox on all post types that restricts the post to a membership. The metabox would previously gain priority over the WordPress publishing actions metabox. The priority has been reduced to "default" and will to fall into line with all other metaboxes on the screen and appear based on registration priority. If you can't find the metabox, SCROLL DOWN! If you want to put it back up on the top, you can simply drag it up there and WordPress will save your preference.

##### Deprecated Classes

We've added a "deprecated" file which holds a few stubs for classes and functions deprecated below as to prevent fatal errors. The functions and classes in the deprecated class are classes which we know are being utilized by approved LifterLMS extensions and will allow users to upgrade LifterLMS without upgrade extensions without breaking their websites!

+ `LLMS_Activate` which as previously used to activate the plugin for updates via the LifterLMS Update Server and is no longer required.
+ PUC (plugin update checker) Library has been completely removed as it is no longer required for plugin updates.
+ `LLMS_Analytics_Dashboard` was removed as it was a stub that was never used and shouldn't have ever been released as a part of the LifterLMS codebase. I can't believe no one reported this bug!

##### Deprecated Functions

+  `lifterlms_template_section_syllabus()`

**The following are officially deprecated and removed to prevent WooCommerce compatibility conflicts**

+ `is_shop()` replaced by `is_llms_shop()`

v1.5.0 - 2016-01-22
-------------------

##### WooCommerce Integration Enhancements

__NOTE: The following enhancements only apply when the WooCommerce Integration is enabled__

**Always redirect to the WooCommerce Cart when a SKU Matched Product can be found**

+ LifterLMS Products (courses and memberships) which are SKU matched to a WooCommerce product will now automatically add the related WooCommerce product to the WooCommerce shopping cart and then automatically redirect the visitor to the WooCommerce cart when the visitor attempts to enroll in a course or membership from the LifterLMS course or membership page.
+ If no WooCommerce product is found via a SKU match, the user will proceed to the LifterLMS checkout.
+ This will enable you to determine which Cart you want a user to use on a product by product basis. You may sell certain courses via WooCommerce and others via LifterLMS (should you choose to do so).

**Multiple Item Checkout**

+ When a WooCommerce order is complete user's will now be automatically enrolled in **all** courses and/or memberships in the WooCommerce order. This improves upon a previously limitation that would only allow WooCommerce checkout with one LifterLMS product at a time.
+ The products in the order will be intelligently SKU matched to LifterLMS Courses or Memberships.
+ You may also mix and match between WooCommerce products matched to LifterLMS products and those which are not matched to LifterLMS products. For example, your customers may now buy a Course via SKU matching as well as a T-Shirt that is not matched to a LifterLMS course via a SKU.

##### Other Fixes and improvements

+ Fixed a bug that caused quiz results to display for users who had never taken the quiz.
+ Added Wistia as an oEmbed provider to fix an issue related to default oembed handling in WordPress 4.4.
+ added a `.cc_cvv` class that mimics the existing `#cc_cvv` styles to allow gateway extensions to change the ID of the field in their credit card forms
+ Added support for new 1.4.5 capability fixes to be also be reflected under the "+New" menu item in the WP Admin Bar. There are no changes to the filters, the capability filters will simply also remove restricted post types from the admin bar now (as they should).
+ Tested and compatible up to WordPress 4.4.1

##### Deprecations

**The following functions have been staged for deprecation in LifterLMS 2.0!**

+ Setup the `is_account_page()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_account_page()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_account_page()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of the function.
+ Setup the `is_checkout()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_checkout()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_checkout()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of the function.


v1.4.5 - 2016-01-13
-------------------

+ Significant improvements to LifterLMS admin permissions as well as a hardening of permissions. Previously LifterLMS admin screens and menus were available to any users with `edit_posts` capabilities. This has been changed to `manage_options`. Filters for all screens and menus have been added with this release. If you're site currently relies on users with `edit_posts` to be able to access LifterLMS settings and analytics screens you must utilize these new filters in order to maintain their access. Please see full documentation on the new filters at [https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/filters-admin-menu-and-screen-permissions](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/filters-admin-menu-and-screen-permissions). **Please consider testing your changes outside of production before updating to LifterLMS 1.4.5 in production.**

  + `llms_user_enrolled_in_course`, called when users are enrolled in a course. Usage details available [here](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/actions-user#llms_user_enrolled_in_course).
  + `llms_user_added_to_membership_level`, called when users are added to a membership level. Usage details available [here](https://lifterlms.readme.io/docs/actions-user#llms_user_added_to_membership_level).

+ Added basic styles to LifterLMS pagination HTML elements (elements with class `.llms-pagination`) which formerly had no associated CSS.

##### Deprecations

+ Setup the `is_shop()` function to be replaced by `is_llms_shop()` function. The original causes conflicts when WooCommerce is installed as WooCommerce includes a core function by the same name. All references to `is_shop()` in LifterLMS have been removed and the original has been left to prevent issues with developers currently relying on the LifterLMS version of the function. It *will* be removed in the next major update (2.0) and will be noted as an officially deprecated feature at that time.
