Visit our [full system requirements](https://lifterlms.com/docs/minimum-system-requirements-lifterlms/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) for additional information.

#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for full instruction on Manual Plugin Installation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum.

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

== Changelog ==


= v3.28.1 - 2019-02-01 =
------------------------

+ Fixed an issues preventing exports to be accessible on Apache servers.
+ Fixed an issue causing servers with certain nginx rules to open CSV exports directly instead of downloading them.


= v3.28.0 - 2019-01-29 =
------------------------

##### Updates

+ Updated reporting table export functions to provide immediate download prompts of the files. Exports are generated in real time and you *must* remain on the page while it generates. The good news is if your site had issues with email or cronjobs it'll no longer be an issue for you.
+ Updated lesson metabox to use icons for attached quizzes
+ Added an orange highlight to the admin "Add-Ons & More" menu item
+ Removed unused cron event.

##### LifterLMS Blocks

+ Updated LifterLMS Blocks to 1.3.4
+ Adds support for handling courses & lessons in "Classic Editor" mode as defined by the Divi page builder
+ Skips course and lesson migration when "Classic" mode is enabled.
+ Adds conditions to identify "Classic" mode when the Classic Editor plugin settings are configured to enforce classic (or block) mode for *all* posts.

##### Database Updates

+ Unschedules the aforementioned unused cron event.

##### Bug fixes

+ Fixed an issue preventing the temp directory old file cleanup cron from firing on schedule.
+ During plugin uninstallation the tmp cleanup cron will now be properly unscheduled.
+ Fixed an issue causing notifications on the student dashboard to appear on top of static headers or the WP Admin Bar when scrolling.
+ Fixed an issue preventing manual updating of customer and source information on orders resulting from unfocusable hidden form fields.
+ Fixed mismatched HTML tags on the Admin Add-Ons screen

##### Deprecations

+ Class method: `LLMS_Admin_Table::queue_export()`

= v3.27.0 - 2019-01-22 =
------------------------

###### Updates

+ Added the ability to add existing questions to a quiz in the course builder. This allows cloning of existing questions as well as attaching "orphaned" questions currently attached to no quizzes.
+ Added the ability to detach questions from quizzes. Coupled with adding existing questions, questions can now be easily moved between quizzes.
+ Added permalink capabilities to the builder to allow linking to specific items within the builder (a lesson, quiz, etc...).
+ Quizzes with 0 possible points will no longer show a Pass/Fail chart with a 0% (failing) grade on quiz results screens.
+ Replaced option `lifterlms_lock_down` which cannot be set via any setting with a filter to reduce database calls. This will have no effect on anyone unless you manually set this option to "no" via a database query. Having done this would allow the admin bar to be shown to students.

##### Bug Fixes
