# **Scaling LifterLMS From A Simple Online Course...**

LifterLMS is incredibly flexible, customizable and scalable. It can be used for a simple one course website, and it can also be used as course marketplace or multi instructor online school. LifterLMS can handle small sites with low course enrollments, and it's also used in large universities and inside fortune 500 corporations for employee training. 

Unlike hosted LMS software where you would pay monthly for access and pay more as your platform grows, LifterLMS does not charge you more per course. LifterLMS also does not charge you more per instructor or per student or based on your revenue.

Some LifterLMS websites are small in terms of course and membership enrollments by design. Some are quite large in the hundreds of thousand of course enrollments. The largest site we know about has 734,415 course enrollments. 

Wether you are going big or keeping it small, LifterLMS can scale to your needs for your online course, membership site, training portal, or remote school. 

# **What Others Are Saying About LifterLMS for Course Building, Membership Sites, and Remote Schools...**

> _"I've used a number of course creation and delivery platforms over the years. And they were all fine… right up to the day when they weren't. The trouble is, they all want you to package and manage your course the way THEY think you should do it. THEIR feature set. THEIR way to do it. **Now I host all my courses on LifterLMS. TOTALLY different experience, because I'm free to do things MY way. I've never yet hit a wall where LifterLMS didn't enable me to do things the way I wanted.** Love it! Great support and community too."_

> _**Nick Usborne**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _“**WP101.com serves more than 30,000 members**, so it’s no small challenge to migrate to a new membership plugin. **We spent more than a year carefully evaluating dozens of LMS and membership plugins before we finally discovered LifterLMS (a membership plugin and LMS plugin combined into one). It was the only plugin that checked all the boxes for our needs for course creation and membership functionality.** And the LifterLMS team also shares our passion for creating better online learning experiences. In particular, we deeply resonate with their goal of restoring the human touch to online learning—something that is absent from most online courses today.”_

> _**Shawn Hesketh**, Owner, WP101_

***

> _"As a former School Teacher, professional User Experience Designer, and current online course creator – I can honestly attribute much of our success to LifterLMS and it’s consideration for multiple learning modalities, the LMS UI/UX out of the box, and natural student Engagement opportunities. **In less than 10 months we’ve gone from $0 to $300K in revenue with LifterLMS** playing a huge part in that!! I’m looking forward to everything that comes next from the creators of LifterLMS!!"_

> _**Sarah Lorenzen**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _"LifterLMS has been **the best decision we have made** towards the build out of our course library, online Learning Management System site, and community. The breadth and depth of what LifterLMS offers in a few WordPress plugins exceeds anything else we evaluated as it includes: easy course construction, integrated eCommerce, community capabilities, gamification and the support for delivery of 1-on-1 coaching collaboration services. Lifter also has pre-built integrations with other key WordPress technologies we wanted to use. LifterLMS has attracted a solid community and support network of leading experts to help guide anyone who wants to transform the world or their industry with online training. **Chris and the Lifter team are real people, and they care**."_

> _**Michael Wolf**, CEO, emPowering NOW LLC (Golden XPR)_

***

> _"I bought/installed LifterLMS yesterday then spent the day having a blast! Two years ago I started writing a book, which morphed into wanting to present the material online in a more interactive way. I started my website from scratch in January and installing the WordPress LMS plugin was a milestone moment! A milestone moment that turned out to be one joy right after the other! I'm always amazed when something is made easy! The LifterLMS product is amazing!! Power to the people! **Really quite extraordinary to have something so helpful be able to be in the hands of regular folk**."_

> _**Margot Worthy**, Author, Teacher_

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where do I buy LifterLMS add-ons or bundles?

You can explore the individual add-ons [here](https://lifterlms.com/store/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) or save BIG with a [bundle](https://lifterlms.com/product-category/bundles/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale)


#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider [purchasing a product from LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com/pricing/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) so you can access the LifterLMS support team.

If you're already a LifterLMS customer, you can simply log into your account and contact the support team directly on the [LifterLMS website](https://lifterlms.com/my-account/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale). We can provide a deeper level of support in there and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

= v6.0.0 - 2022-03-08 =

**This major release of LifterLMS focuses on improving the experience of creating, designing, and managing achievements and certificates: use the block editor to design certificates, sync awards with their templates, award achievements and certificates on demand without requiring an engagement trigger, and [much more](https://lifterlms.com/docs/getting-started-with-lifterlms-6-0/). In addition, this release removes a significant number of previously deprecated classes, methods, and functions. Please read the full Breaking Changes sections for more information on removed code.**

##### New Features

+ The block editor is now enabled by default for certificates when using WordPress versions 5.8 and later.
  + Existing certificates are marked as "legacy" and will continue to use the classic editor until migrated.
  + To migrate a certificate, click the "Migrate Certificate" button. This will force the certificate's content into blocks.
+ A number of new settings are available to certificates when using the block editor:
  + Set the certificate's display (and print) size using common paper sizes such as US Letter, US Legal, A3, A4, and more.
  + Set the certificate's display orientation: portrait of landscape.
  + Set the certificate's inner margins.
  + Set the certificate's background color.
+ A new block, the Certificate Title Block, has been made available to certificates.
  + The block works like a WordPress core Heading Block with added options for selecting from a few display fonts (provided by Google Web Fonts).
  + The block controls the title of awarded certificates.
+ Added the ability for administrators and LMS managers to edit earned certificates/achievements from the students reporting screen, as well as award new certificates/achievements to students.
+ Added the ability to sync awarded certificates with the template used to generate them. [#1078](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1078)
+ The `post_name` of earned certificate posts will be generated with a randomized 3+ character string in favor of relying on sequential numbers.
+ Added certificate global options for the default size of new certificates and certificate templates.
+ Certificate and email template merge code buttons now include [llms-user] information shortcodes.
+ Added certificate sequential ID functionality merge code.
+ Added a link to return to the student dashboard when viewing an awarded certificate. [#1959](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1959)
+ Provide additional information to hooks on the student single course reporting screen.

##### Updates and Enhancements

+ Added new default images for use with achievements and certificates.
  + The site-wide default images can be customized on the admin panel under Settings -> Engagements.
  + The old default images will automatically be used for legacy certificates and can be forced by filtering `llms_use_legacy_engagement_images`. [#1081](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1081)
+ Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from the site's theme, instead custom templates (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`) are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and more, especially when printing certificates. [#463](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/463)
+ The achievements and certificates dashboard endpoints are now paginated. [#669](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/669)
+ Added pagination to achievement and certificate reporting pages.
+ The URL of earned user certificates has been changed from "my_certificate" to "certificate". Requests to the old url are automatically redirected to the new url, including instances where the URL slug has been translated.
+ The URL of certificate template previews has been changed from "certificate" to "certificate-template".
+ The certificate merge code, `{first_name}`, now outputs an empty string in favor of falling back to the user's nickname when there is no first name for the user. [#1640](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1640)
+ The look and behavior of the certificate {{MINI_CERTIFICATE}} pop-over notification merge code now displays a placeholder preview of the certificate in favor of attempting to render a tiny version of the actual certificate. [#1950](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1950)
+ The coupon code in the student's order details table is now wrapped in a `<code>` tag instead of an `<a>` tag. [#2033](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2033)
+ Updates LifterLMS REST to [v1.0.0-beta.23](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/23/lifterlms-rest-api-version-1-0-0-beta-23/).
+ Updated LifterLMS Blocks to [version 2.4.0](https://make.lifterlms.com/2022/02/25/lifterlms-blocks-version-2-4-0/).

##### Bug Fixes

+ Delayed engagements are automatically unscheduled when the related post is deleted.
+ A disabled student dashboard endpoint will no longer display the endpoint's summary on the main dashboard page. [#535](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/535)
+ Prior to sending a delayed engagement the recipient's enrollment in the related post is verified resulting the engagement not being triggered if the recipient's enrollment has been terminated. [#290](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/290)
+ Post search filter boxes on various post tables will now longer display a link to the selected post.
+ Basic notification code is no longer loaded on the admin panel.
+ Fixed the label hover on picture type quizzes in some themes. [#2015](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2015)

##### Database Migration

+ A database migration is required when upgrading from versions earlier than 6.0.0. A description of the required updates can be found at [https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-database-updates/#600](https://lifterlms.com/docs/lifterlms-database-updates/#600).

##### Deprecations

+ Public access to properties of the abstract `LLMS_Database_Query` has been deprecated.

##### Developer Notes

+ Added `LLMS_Awards_Query`, used for querying data about awarded certificates and achievements.
  + The method signature `LLMS_Student::get_achievements()` and `LLMS_Student::get_certificates()` now use this class under tho hood.
  + The previous method signature, which passed data into a direct SQL query, is now deprecated.
+ Achievement and certificate data storage locations have been modified, primarily to reduce reliance on the `wp_postmeta` table which will result in a site-wide performance improvement, especially on large sites.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_content` and `_llms_certificate_content` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_content`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_title` and `_llms_certificate_title` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_title`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_template` and `_llms_certificate_template` have been removed in favor of `WP_Post::$post_parent`.
  + Meta properties `_llms_achievement_image` and `_llms_certificate_image` have been moved the meta property `_thumbnail_id` in order to utilize the WordPress core's featured image functionality and internal APIs.
+ Reliance on `lifterlms_user_postmeta` for achievement and certificate data will be removed in a future release.
  + User postmeta properties `_achievement_earned` and `_certificate_earned` will continue to be recorded but are no longer being used internally.
  + The `updated_date` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_date`.
  + The `user_id` is now accessible via `WP_Post::$post_author`.
+ Added new Javascript UI components library, modeled after `@wordpress/components`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/components).
+ Added a new SVG icon library, modeled after `@wordpress/icons`. [Read more](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/tree/dev-600/packages/icons).
+ The merge code button seen on certificate and email template editors is now an SVG image instead of a PNG.
+ Added utility function for escaping and quoting strings. [#1027](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/1027)
+ Added the ability to force an admin metabox field value through the new `meta` arg. [#2016](https://github.com/gocodebox/lifterlms/issues/2016)
+ Added new utility function for stripping prefixes from strings.

##### Performance Improvements

+ Increased the number of files that are autoloaded instead of manually loaded.
