Visit our [full system requirements](https://lifterlms.com/docs/minimum-system-requirements-lifterlms/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) for additional information.

#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for full instruction on Manual Plugin Installation.

You can return to the setup wizard at any time by following [these steps](https://lifterlms.com/docs/rerun-lifterlms-setup-wizard/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a [LifterLMS Pro license](https://lifterlms.com/product/lifterlms-pro/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.


#### LifterLMS is awesome! Can you set it all up for me?

Yes. You can get an instant quote for the team at LifterLMS to set everything up for you through our signature Done For You service. Get an instant quote through our automated quote generation tool on the [LifterLMS website services page](https://lifterlms.com/dfy/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).
