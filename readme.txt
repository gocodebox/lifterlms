#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum.

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

+ Added a filter to allow customization of the URL used to generate certificate downloads from
+ When viewing taxonomy archives for any course or memberhip taxonomy (categories, tags, and tracks), if a term description exists, it will be used instead of the default catalog description content defined on the catalog page.
+ Added a filter (`llms_archive_description`) to allow filtering of the archive description
+ When `WP_DEBUG` is disabled the scheduled-actions posttype interface is now available via direct link. Useful for debugging but don't want to expose a menu-item link to clients. Access via wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=scheduled-action. Be warned: you shouldn't be modifying scheduled actions manually and that's why we're not exposing this directly, this should be used for debugging only!
+ Updated the function used to check if lessons have featured images to improve performance and resolve an incompatibility issue with WP Overlays plugin.

+ Fixed issue causing "My Courses" title to be duplicated on the student dashboard when viewing the endpoint
+ Fixed issue causing the trial price to be displayed with a strike-through during a sale
