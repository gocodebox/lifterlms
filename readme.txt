### Scaling LifterLMS From A Simple Online Course

LifterLMS is incredibly flexible, customizable and scalable. It can be used for a simple one course website, and it can also be used as a course marketplace or multi instructor online school.

The plugin is lightweight enough to handle niche sites with low course enrollments, while also powering huge universities and employee training in Fortune 500 corporations. We've even worked with a site that has over 730,000 course enrollments.

Unlike hosted LMS software where you would pay increasing monthly fees for access and growth, LifterLMS does not charge you more per course. LifterLMS also does not charge you more per instructor or per student or based on your revenue.

Whether you are going big or keeping it small, LifterLMS scales to meet your needs for online courses, memberships, training portals, or remote schools.

### What Others Are Saying About LifterLMS

> _"I've used a number of course creation and delivery platforms over the years. And they were all fine… right up to the day when they weren't. The trouble is, they all want you to package and manage your course the way THEY think you should do it. THEIR feature set. THEIR way to do it. **Now I host all my courses on LifterLMS. TOTALLY different experience, because I'm free to do things MY way. I've never yet hit a wall where LifterLMS didn't enable me to do things the way I wanted.** Love it! Great support and community too."_

> _**Nick Usborne**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _“**WP101.com serves more than 30,000 members**, so it’s no small challenge to migrate to a new membership plugin. **We spent more than a year carefully evaluating dozens of LMS and membership plugins before we finally discovered LifterLMS (a membership plugin and LMS plugin combined into one). It was the only plugin that checked all the boxes for our needs for course creation and membership functionality.** And the LifterLMS team also shares our passion for creating better online learning experiences. In particular, we deeply resonate with their goal of restoring the human touch to online learning—something that is absent from most online courses today.”_

> _**Shawn Hesketh**, Owner, WP101_

***

> _"As a former School Teacher, professional User Experience Designer, and current online course creator – I can honestly attribute much of our success to LifterLMS and it’s consideration for multiple learning modalities, the LMS UI/UX out of the box, and natural student Engagement opportunities. **In less than 10 months we’ve gone from $0 to $300K in revenue with LifterLMS** playing a huge part in that!! I’m looking forward to everything that comes next from the creators of LifterLMS!!"_

> _**Sarah Lorenzen**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _"LifterLMS has been **the best decision we have made** towards the build out of our course library, online Learning Management System site, and community. The breadth and depth of what LifterLMS offers in a few WordPress plugins exceeds anything else we evaluated as it includes: easy course construction, integrated eCommerce, community capabilities, gamification and the support for delivery of 1-on-1 coaching collaboration services. Lifter also has pre-built integrations with other key WordPress technologies we wanted to use. LifterLMS has attracted a solid community and support network of leading experts to help guide anyone who wants to transform the world or their industry with online training. **Chris and the Lifter team are real people, and they care**."_

> _**Michael Wolf**, CEO, emPowering NOW LLC (Golden XPR)_

***

> _"I bought/installed LifterLMS yesterday then spent the day having a blast! Two years ago I started writing a book, which morphed into wanting to present the material online in a more interactive way. I started my website from scratch in January and installing the WordPress LMS plugin was a milestone moment! A milestone moment that turned out to be one joy right after the other! I'm always amazed when something is made easy! The LifterLMS product is amazing!! Power to the people! **Really quite extraordinary to have something so helpful be able to be in the hands of regular folk**."_

> _**Margot Worthy**, Author, Teacher_

+ WordPress 5.6 or later
+ MySQL 5.6 or later

Visit our [full system requirements](https://lifterlms.com/docs/minimum-system-requirements-lifterlms/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) for additional information.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field, type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS, click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation-1) for full instructions on Manual Plugin Installation.

The wizard includes a few sample courses you can import if you want to see some examples before you start creating your own content.

You can return to the setup wizard at any time by following [these steps](https://lifterlms.com/docs/rerun-lifterlms-setup-wizard/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where do I buy add-ons or bundles for my LifterLMS eLearning Website?

You can explore the individual learning management system add-ons [here](https://lifterlms.com/store/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) or save BIG with a [bundle](https://lifterlms.com/product-category/bundles/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale)


#### How do I troubleshoot issues with my LMS website?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS plugins active on your site, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### How do I ask a question about my online course website?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions here in our WordPress.org support area. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider [purchasing a product from LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com/pricing/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) so you can access the LifterLMS support team.

If you're already a LifterLMS customer, you can simply log into your account and contact the support team directly on the [LifterLMS website](https://lifterlms.com/my-account/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale). We can provide a deeper level of support in there and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.


#### LifterLMS is awesome! Can you set up my online course site for me?

LifterLMS offers technical support, but we do not offer custom website development services. However, we do recommend third party LifterLMS Experts who can help with web design, web development, instructional design or marketing for a fee.
