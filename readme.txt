#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) for full instruction on Manual Plugin Installation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

+ Students can drill into individual reporting screens for each course where specific details for each course are available for review

##### Grading Enhancements

+ Added `student_id` as a parameter passed to the `llms_student_get_progress` filter
+ Updated all access plan templates added in 3.23.0 to ensure `ABSPATH` is defined to prevent direct template access
+ Remove use of deprecated `LLMS_Lesson->get_children_lessons()` in the `LLMS_Course` and `LLMS_Lesson` models as well as in the `course/syllabus.php` template
+ Refactored the `LLMS_Section->get_percent_complete()` method to utilize methods from the `LLMS_Student` model

+ When an order is deleted, all order transactions will also be deleted. This does not happen until the order is deleted (transactions will remain while the order is in the trash)

##### Deprecated Functions & Methods

+ Deprecated `LLMS_Section->get_children_lessons()`, use `LLMS_Section->get_lessons( 'posts' )` instead

##### Template Updates
