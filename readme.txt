#### Automatic Installation

This is the simplest way to install LifterLMS as it utilizes WordPress to handle file transfers and you never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. You'll then need to use FTP to manually upload the files to the proper directory on your webserver.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.

== Changelog ==


= v3.27.0 - 2019-01-22 =
------------------------

###### Updates

+ Added the ability to add existing questions to a quiz in the course builder. This allows cloning of existing questions as well as attaching "orphaned" questions currently attached to no quizzes.
+ Added the ability to detach questions from quizzes. Coupled with adding existing questions, questions can now be easily moved between quizzes.
+ Added permalink capabilities to the builder to allow linking to specific items within the builder (a lesson, quiz, etc...).
+ Quizzes with 0 possible points will no longer show a Pass/Fail chart with a 0% (failing) grade on quiz results screens.
+ Replaced option `lifterlms_lock_down` which cannot be set via any setting with a filter to reduce database calls. This will have no effect on anyone unless you manually set this option to "no" via a database query. Having done this would allow the admin bar to be shown to students.

+ Fixed issue causing LifterLMS core sales pages from outputting automatic content (like pricing tables) on migrated posts.
