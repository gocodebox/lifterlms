LifterLMS, the #1 WordPress LMS solution, makes it easy to create, sell, and protect engaging online courses.


== Description ==

**LifterLMS is a powerful [WordPress LMS plugin][home] that makes it easy to create, sell, and protect engaging online courses and training based membership websites.** LifterLMS works with any well-coded WordPress theme and all the popular WordPress page builders (like Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, etc.). As an engaged WordPress community member, LifterLMS actively encourages and helps other great plugins integrate with LifterLMS like Affiliate WP, Monster Insights, WP Fusion, the most popular form plugins, GamiPress, Astra Pro, the Course Scheduler, and many more. You can also connect your WordPress LMS website to 1,500+ other apps via Zapier. LifterLMS is one of only 11 WordPress plugins listed in the Zapier app directory. 

LifterLMS strikes a beautiful balance in being an **all-in-one solution** while also integrating with other best of breed technologies relevant to course creators and membership site owners.

# **What Others Are Saying**

> _“**WP101.com serves more than 30,000 members**, so it’s no small challenge to migrate to a new membership plugin. **We spent more than a year carefully evaluating dozens of LMS and membership plugins before we finally discovered LifterLMS. It was the only plugin that checked all the boxes for our needs.** And the LifterLMS team also shares our passion for creating better online learning experiences. In particular, we deeply resonate with their goal of restoring the human touch to online learning—something that is absent from most online courses today.”_

> _**Shawn Hesketh**, Owner, WP101_

***

> _"As a former School Teacher, professional User Experience Designer, and current online course creator – I can honestly attribute much of our success to LifterLMS and it’s consideration for multiple learning modalities, UI/UX out of the box, and natural student Engagement opportunities. **In less than 10 months we’ve gone from $0 to $300K in revenue with LifterLMS** playing a huge part in that!! I’m looking forward to everything that comes next from the creators of LifterLMS!!"_

> _**Sarah Lorenzen**, Teacher, Entrepreneur_

***

> _"LifterLMS has been **the best decision we have made** towards the build out of our online Learning Management site and community. The breadth and depth of what Lifter offers in a few WordPress plugins exceeds anything else we evaluated as it includes: easy course construction, integrated eCommerce, community capabilities, gamification and the support for delivery of 1-on-1 coaching collaboration services. Lifter also has pre-built integrations with other key WordPress technologies we wanted to use. Lifter has attracted a solid community and support network of leading experts to help guide anyone who wants to transform the world or their industry with online training. **Chris and the Lifter team are real people, and they care**."_

> _**Michael Wolf**, CEO, emPowering NOW LLC (Golden XPR)_

> _"I bought/installed LifterLMS yesterday then spent the day having a blast! Two years ago I started writing a book, which morphed into wanting to present the material online in a more interactive way. I started my website from scratch in January and installing the LMS was a milestone moment! A milestone moment that turned out to be one joy right after the other! I'm always amazed when something is made easy! The LifterLMS product is amazing!!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Where do I buy LifterLMS add-ons or bundles?
You can explore the individual add-ons [here](https://lifterlms.com/store/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale) or save BIG with a [bundle](https://lifterlms.com/product-category/bundles/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale)

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?
