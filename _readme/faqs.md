== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### Are there any troubleshooting steps you'd suggest I try that might resolve my issue before I post a new thread?

First, make sure that you're running the latest version of LifterLMS. And if you've got any other LifterLMS extensions or themes, make sure those are running the most current version as well.

The most common issues we see are either plugin conflicts, theme conflicts, or outdated servers. You can test if a plugin or theme is conflicting by manually deactivating other plugins until just LifterLMS is running on your site. If the issue persists from there, revert to the default Twenty Fifteen theme. If the issue is resolved after deactivating a specific plugin or your theme, you'll know that is the source of the conflict. If it is a hosting issue, contact your web host and make sure they’re running the most current version of PHP.

Also be sure to check out the official LifterLMS [Knowledge Base](https://lifterlms.com/docs/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).


#### I'm still stuck. Where do I go to file a bug or ask a question?

Users of the free LifterLMS should post their questions in the plugin's WordPress.org forum. If you find you're not getting support in as timely a fashion as you wish, you might want to consider purchasing a [LifterLMS Pro license](https://lifterlms.com/product/lifterlms-pro/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale).

If you're already a LifterLMS Pro user or you have purchased one of the LifterLMS themes or extensions, you're entitled to log into your account and contact the support team directly on the [LifterLMS website](https://lifterlms.com/my-account/?utm_source=LifterLMS%20Plugin&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=Readme%20to%20Sale). We can provide a deeper level of support here and address your needs on a daily basis during the work week. Generally, except in times of increased support loads, we reply to all comments within 12 business hours.
