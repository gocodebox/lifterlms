#### Automatic Installation

The simplest way to install LifterLMS is through your existing WordPress site’s admin. Let WordPress handle file transfers for you - you’ll never need to leave the web browser or admin panel.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard
2. Navigate to Plugins -> Add New
3. In the search field, type "LifterLMS" and click "Search Plugins"
4. Once you've located LifterLMS, click "Install Now"
5. Once installation is complete, click "Activate"

#### Manual Installation

To manually install LifterLMS, you'll need to download the zip file using the "Download" link on this screen. Then, use FTP to manually upload the unzipped plugin folder to the proper plugins directory on your webserver.

Please see this [WordPress Codex document](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation-1) for full instructions on Manual Plugin Installation.

#### Setup Wizard

After installation, LifterLMS launches a friendly (and super quick) Setup Wizard.

This wizard helps you configure LifterLMS so you can get to the fun stuff - like creating your courses - as quickly as possible.

The wizard includes a few sample courses you can import if you want to see some examples before you start creating your own content.
