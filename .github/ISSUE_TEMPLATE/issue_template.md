### 5. System Report

Many issues are the result of theme or plugin conflicts. Including information about your WordPress version, your plugins (and their versions), and your theme (and its version) will help us resolve conflicts.
We've created the [LifterLMS System Report](https://lifterlms.com/docs/how-to-use-the-lifterlms-system-report/) to help with this

### 6. Browser, Device, and Operating System

+ If the bug occurs in a specific browser, it is very useful in helping us track down the specifics using this information (as well as version numbers).
